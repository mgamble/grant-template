abstract = {Transcriptional activation requires both access to DNA assembled as chromatin and functional contact with components of the basal transcription machinery. Using the hormone-bound vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) ligand binding domain (LBD) as an affinity matrix, we previously identified a novel multisubunit coactivator complex, DRIP (VDR-interacting proteins), required for transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors and several other transcription factors. In this report, we characterize the nuclear receptor binding features of DRIP205, a key subunit of the DRIP complex, that interacts directly with VDR and thyroid hormone receptor in response to ligand and anchors the other DRIP subunits to the nuclear receptor LBD. In common with other nuclear receptor coactivators, DRIP205 interaction occurs through one of two LXXLL motifs and requires the receptor's AF-2 subdomain. Although the second motif of DRIP205 is required only for VDR binding in vitro, both motifs are used in the context of an retinoid X receptor-VDR heterodimer on DNA and in transactivation in vivo. We demonstrate that both endogenous p160 coactivators and DRIP complexes bind to the VDR LBD from nuclear extracts through similar sequence requirements, but they do so as distinct complexes. Moreover, in contrast to the p160 family of coactivators, the DRIP complex is devoid of any histone acetyltransferase activity. The results demonstrate that different coactivator complexes with distinct functions bind to the same transactivation region of nuclear receptors, suggesting that they are both required for transcription activation by nuclear receptors.},

abstract = {<p>The growth of telomerase-deficient cancers depends on the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a homology-directed telomere-maintenance pathway. ALT telomeres exhibit a unique chromatin environment and generally lack the nucleosome remodeler ATRX, pointing to an epigenetic basis for ALT. Recently, we identified a protective role for the ATRX-interacting macroH2A1.2 histone variant during homologous recombination and replication stress (RS). Consistent with an inherent susceptibility to RS, we show that human ALT telomeres are highly enriched for macroH2A1.2. However, in contrast to ATRX-proficient cells, ALT telomeres transiently lose macroH2A1.2 during acute RS to facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, a process that is almost completely prevented by ectopic ATRX expression. Telomeric macroH2A1.2 is re-deposited in a DNA damage response (DDR)-dependent manner to promote homologous recombination-associated ALT pathways. Our findings thus identify the dynamic exchange of macroH2A1.2 on chromatin as an epigenetic link among ATRX loss, RS-induced DDR initiation and telomere maintenance via homologous recombination.</p>},

abstract = {To uncover factors required for transcription by RNA polymerase II on chromatin, we fractionated a mammalian cell nuclear extract. We identified the histone chaperone TAF-I (also known as INHAT [inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase]), which was previously proposed to repress transcription, as a potent activator of chromatin transcription responsive to the vitamin D  3  receptor or to Gal4-VP16. TAF-I associates with chromatin in vitro and can substitute for the related protein NAP-1 in assembling chromatin onto cloned DNA templates in cooperation with the remodeling enzyme ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor (ACF). The chromatin assembly and transcriptional activation functions are distinct, however, and can be dissociated temporally. Efficient transcription of chromatin assembled with TAF-I still requires the presence of TAF-I during the polymerization reaction. Conversely, TAF-I cannot stimulate transcript elongation when added after the other factors necessary for assembly of a preinitiation complex on naked DNA. Thus, TAF-I is required to facilitate transcription at a step after chromatin assembly but before transcript elongation.},

PARP-1 was enriched and H1 was depleted at these promoters. This pattern of binding was associated with actively transcribed genes. Furthermore, we showed that PARP-1 acts to exclude H1 from a subset of PARP-1-stimulated promoters, suggesting a functional interplay between PARP-1 and H1 at the level of nucleosome binding.

Here, we demonstrate that in primary human cells, macroH2A1 participates in two physically and functionally distinct types of chromatin marked by either H3K27me3 or nine histone acetylations. Using RNA sequencing, we found that macroH2A1-regulated genes, which have roles in cancer progression, are specifically found in macroH2A1-containing acetylated chromatin. Of the two macroH2A1 variants, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, the former is suppressed in cancer and can interact with PARP-generated poly(ADP-ribose). Through the recruitment of PARP-1, macroH2A1.1 promotes the CBP-mediated acetylation of H2B K12 and K120, which either positively or negatively regulates the expression of macroH2A1-target genes. Although macroH2A1-regulated H2B acetylation is a common feature of primary cells, this regulation is typically lost in cancer cells. Consequently, our results provide insight into macroH2A1.1's role in cancer suppression.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. Background: Stored, soluble histones in eggs are essential for early development, in particular during the maternally controlled early cell cycles in the absence of transcription. Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) direct and regulate chromatin-templated transactions, so understanding the nature and function of pre-deposition maternal histones is essential to deciphering mechanisms of regulation of development, chromatin assembly, and transcription. Little is known about histone H2A pre-deposition modifications nor known about the transitions that occur upon the onset of zygotic control of the cell cycle and transcription at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). Results: We isolated histones from staged Xenopus laevis oocytes, eggs, embryos, and assembled pronuclei to identify changes in histone H2A modifications prior to deposition and in chromatin. Soluble and chromatin-bound histones from eggs and embryos demonstrated distinct patterns of maternal and zygotic H2A PTMs, with significant pre-deposition quantities of S1ph and R3me1, and R3me2s. We observed the first functional distinction between H2A and H4 S1 phosphorylation, as we showed that H2A and H2A.X-F (also known as H2A.X.3) serine 1 (S1) is phosphorylated concomitant with germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) while H4 serine 1 phosphorylation occurs post-MBT. In egg extract H2A/H4 S1 phosphorylation is independent of the cell cycle, chromatin assembly, and DNA replication. H2AS1ph is highly enriched on blastula chromatin during repression of zygotic gene expression while H4S1ph is correlated with the beginning of maternal gene expression and the lengthening of the cell cycle, consistent with distinct biological roles for H2A and H4 S1 phosphorylation. We isolated soluble H2A and H2A.X-F from the egg and chromatin-bound in pronuclei and analyzed them by mass spectrometry analysis to quantitatively determine abundances of S1ph and R3 methylation. We show that H2A and H4 S1ph, R3me1 and R3me2s are enriched on nucleosomes containing both active and repressive histone PTMs in human A549 cells and Xenopus embryos. Conclusions: Significantly, we demonstrated that H2A phosphorylation and H4 arginine methylation form a new class of bona fide pre-deposition modifications in the vertebrate embryo. We show that S1ph and R3me containing chromatin domains are not correlated with H3 regulatory PTMs, suggesting a unique role for phosphorylation and arginine methylation.},

One of the major functions of SIRT1 is to regulate target gene transcription through modification of chromatin-associated proteins. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which NAD +  biosynthetic enzymes regulate SIRT1 activity to control gene transcription in the nucleus. In this study we show that stable short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of NAMPT or NMNAT-1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells reduces total cellular NAD +  levels and alters global patterns of gene expression. Furthermore, we show that SIRT1 plays a key role in mediating the gene regulatory effects of NAMPT and NMNAT-1. Specifically, we found that SIRT1 binds to the promoters of genes commonly regulated by NAMPT, NMNAT-1, and SIRT1 and that SIRT1 histone deacetylase activity is regulated by NAMPT and NMNAT-1 at these promoters. Most significantly, NMNAT-1 interacts with, and is recruited to target gene promoters by SIRT1. Collectively, our results reveal a mechanism for the direct control of SIRT1 deacetylase activity at a set of target gene promoters by NMNAT-1. This mechanism, in collaboration with NAMPT-dependent regulation of nuclear NAD +  production, establishes an important pathway for transcription regulation by NAD + . {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Results showed that PADI4 is enriched in gene promoter regions near transcription start sites (TSSs); and, surprisingly, this pattern of binding is primarily associated with actively transcribed genes. Computational analysis found potential binding sites for Elk-1, a member of the ETS oncogene family, to be highly enriched around PADI4 binding sites; and coimmunoprecipitation analysis then confirmed that Elk-1 physically associates with PADI4. To better understand how PADI4 may facilitate gene transactivation, we then show that PADI4 interacts with Elk-1 at the c-Fos promoter and that, following Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulation, PADI4 catalytic activity facilitates Elk-1 phosphorylation, histone H4 acetylation, and c-Fos transcriptional activation. These results define a novel role for PADI4 as a transcription factor co-activator.},

abstract = {Nuclear receptors modulate the transcription of genes in direct response to small lipophilic ligands. Binding to ligands induces conformational changes in the nuclear receptors that enable the receptors to interact with several types of cofactor that are critical for transcription activation (transactivation). We previously described a distinct set of ligand-dependent proteins called DRIPs, which interact with the vitamin D receptor (VDR); together, these proteins constitute a new cofactor complex. DRIPs bind to several nuclear receptors and mediate ligand-dependent enhancement of transcription by VDR and the thyroid-hormone receptor in cell-free transcription assays. Here we report the identities of thirteen DRIPs that constitute this complex, and show that the complex has a central function in hormone-dependent transactivation by VDR on chromatin templates. The DRIPs are almost indistinguishable from components of another new cofactor complex called ARC, which is recruited by other types of transcription activators to mediate transactivation on chromatin-assembled templates. Several DRIP/ARC subunits are also components of other potentially related cofactors, such as CRSP, NAT, SMCC and the mouse Mediator, indicating that unique classes of activators may share common sets or subsets of cofactors. The role of nuclear-receptor ligands may in part, be to recruit such a cofactor complex to the receptor and, in doing so, to enhance transcription of target genes.},

Due to its enrichment on the inactive X chromosome, macroH2A1 was thought to play a role in transcriptional repression. However, recent studies have shown that macroH2A1 occupies autosomal chromatin and regulates genes in a context-specific manner. The macrodomain may play a role in the modulation of gene expression outcomes via physical interactions with effector proteins, which may depend on the ability of the macrodomain to bind NAD(+) metabolite ligands. Here, we identify proline, glutamic acid, and leucine rich protein 1 (PELP1), a chromatin-associated factor and transcriptional coregulator, as a ligand-independent macrodomain-interacting factor. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with tiling microarrays (ChIP-chip) to determine the genomic localization of PELP1 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We find that PELP1 genomic localization is highly correlated with that of macroH2A1. Additionally, PELP1 positively correlates with heterochromatic chromatin marks and negatively correlates with active transcription marks, much like macroH2A1. MacroH2A1 specifically recruits PELP1 to the promoters of macroH2A1 target genes, but macroH2A1 occupancy occurs independent of PELP1. This recruitment allows for macroH2A1 and PELP1 to cooperatively regulate gene expression outcomes.},

While the macro domain of macroH2A1.1 can interact with NAD(+)-derived small molecules, such as poly(ADP-ribose), macroH2A1.2's macro domain cannot. Here, we show that changes in the alternative splicing of macroH2A1 pre-mRNA, which lead to a decrease in macroH2A1.1 expression, occur in a variety of cancers, including testicular, lung, bladder, cervical, breast, colon, ovarian, and endometrial. Furthermore, reintroduction of macroH2A1.1 suppresses the proliferation of lung and cervical cancer cells in a manner that requires the ability of macroH2A1.1 to bind NAD(+)-derived metabolites. MacroH2A1.1-mediated suppression of proliferation occurs, at least in part, through the reduction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) protein levels. By analyzing publically available expression and splicing microarray data, we identified splicing factors that correlate with alterations in macroH2A1 splicing. Using RNA interference, we demonstrate that one of these factors, QKI, regulates the alternative splicing of macroH2A1 pre-mRNA, resulting in increased levels of macroH2A1.1. Finally, we demonstrate that QKI expression is significantly reduced in many of the same cancer types that demonstrate a reduction in macroH2A1.1 splicing.},

We now show that the loss of S100A4 produces two mechanistically distinct phenotypes with regard to macrophage invasion: a defect in matrix degradation, due to a disruption of podosome rosettes caused by myosin-IIA overassembly, and a myosin-independent increase in microtubule acetylation, which increases podosome rosette stability and is sufficient to inhibit macrophage invasion. Our studies point to S100A4 as a critical regulator of matrix degradation, whose actions converge on the dynamics and degradative functions of podosome rosettes.},

Although a role for PARP-1 in gene regulation has been well established, the role of PARG is less clear. To investigate how PARP-1 and PARG coordinately regulate global patterns of gene expression, we used short hairpin RNAs to stably knock down PARP-1 or PARG in MCF-7 cells followed by expression microarray analyses. Correlation analyses showed that the majority of genes affected by the knockdown of one factor were similarly affected by the knockdown of the other factor. The most robustly regulated common genes were enriched for stress-response and metabolic functions. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, PARP-1 and PARG localized to the promoters of positively and negatively regulated target genes. The levels of chromatin-bound PARG at a given promoter generally correlated with the levels of PARP-1 across the subset of promoters tested. For about half of the genes tested, the binding of PARP-1 at the promoter was dependent on the binding of PARG. Experiments using stable re-expression of short hairpin RNA-resistant catalytic mutants showed that PARP-1 and PARG enzymatic activities are required for some, but not all, target genes. Collectively, our results indicate that PARP-1 and PARG, nuclear enzymes with opposing enzymatic activities, localize to target promoters and act in a similar, rather than antagonistic, manner to regulate gene expression.},

Here, we demonstrate macroH2A1 incorporation into H2B-acetylated chromatin requires a feature in its histone-fold domain, distinguishing this process from incorporation into H3K27me3-containing chromatin in which multiple features of macroH2A1 are sufficient for targeting. In addition, we identify H2BK20 acetylation as a critical modification required to target macroH2A1 to H2B-acetylated chromatin. Our findings have allowed us to definitively establish that macroH2A1's regulation of an important transcriptional program, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), requires its accurate genomic localization.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a biological program that plays key roles in various developmental and pathological processes. Although much work has been done on signaling pathways and transcription factors regulating EMT, the epigenetic regulation of EMT remains not well understood. Histone variants have been recognized as a key group of epigenetic regulators. Among them, macroH2A1 is involved in stem cell reprogramming and cancer progression. We postulated that macroH2A1 may play a role in EMT, a process involving reprogramming of cellular states. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of macroH2A1 is dramatically reduced during EMT induction in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE). Moreover, ectopic expression of the macroH2A1.1 isoform, but not macroH2A1.2, can suppress EMT induction and reduce the stem-like cell population in HMLE. Interestingly, macroH2A1.1 overexpression cannot revert stable mesenchymal cells back to the epithelial state, suggesting a stage-specific role of macroH2A1.1 in EMT. We further pinpointed that the function of macroH2A1.1 in EMT suppression is dependent on its ability to bind the NAD + metabolite PAR, in agreement with the inability to suppress EMT by macroH2A1.2, which lacks the PAR binding domain. Thus, our work discovered a previously unrecognized isoform-specific function of macroH2A1 in regulating EMT induction.},

abstract = {To uncover factors required for transcription by RNA polymerase II on chromatin, we fractionated a mammalian cell nuclear extract. We identified the histone chaperone TAF-I (also known as INHAT [inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase]), which was previously proposed to repress transcription, as a potent activator of chromatin transcription responsive to the vitamin D  3  receptor or to Gal4-VP16. TAF-I associates with chromatin in vitro and can substitute for the related protein NAP-1 in assembling chromatin onto cloned DNA templates in cooperation with the remodeling enzyme ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor (ACF). The chromatin assembly and transcriptional activation functions are distinct, however, and can be dissociated temporally. Efficient transcription of chromatin assembled with TAF-I still requires the presence of TAF-I during the polymerization reaction. Conversely, TAF-I cannot stimulate transcript elongation when added after the other factors necessary for assembly of a preinitiation complex on naked DNA. Thus, TAF-I is required to facilitate transcription at a step after chromatin assembly but before transcript elongation.},

Using a variety of biochemical, molecular, cell-based, and genomic assays, we show that NMNAT-1 and PARP-1 physically and functionally interact at target gene promoters in MCF-7 cells. Specifically, we show that PARP-1 recruits NMNAT-1 to promoters where it produces NAD(+) to support PARP-1 catalytic activity, but also enhances the enzymatic activity of PARP-1 independently of NAD(+) production. Furthermore, using two-photon excitation microscopy, we show that NMNAT-1 catalyzes the production of NAD(+) in a nuclear pool that may be distinct from other cellular compartments. In expression microarray experiments, depletion of NMNAT-1 or PARP-1 alters the expression of about 200 protein-coding genes each, with about 10% overlap between the two gene sets. NMNAT-1 enzymatic activity is required for PARP-1-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation at the promoters of commonly regulated target genes, as well as the expression of those target genes. Collectively, our studies link the enzymatic activities of NMNAT-1 and PARP-1 to the regulation of a set of common target genes through functional interactions at target gene promoters.},

abstract = {MacroH2A1 is a histone variant that is enriched on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in mammals and is postulated to play an important, but unknown, role in the repression of gene expression. Here we show that, although macroH2A1 marks repressed autosomal chromatin, it positively regulates transcription when located in the transcribed regions of a subset of its target genes. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with tiling microarrays (ChIP-chip) to determine the genomic localization of macroH2A1 in IMR90 human primary lung fibroblasts and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The patterns of macroH2A1 deposition are largely similar across the autosomes of both cell lines. Our studies revealed a genomic localization pattern unique among histone variants; namely, the occupation by macroH2A1 of large chromatin domains (>500 kb in some cases) that contain repressive chromatin marks (e.g., histone H3 Lys 27 trimethylation). The boundaries of macroH2A1-containing domains tend to occur in promoter-proximal regions. Not all promoters, however, serve as macroH2A1 boundaries; many macroH2A1-containing chromatin domains invade the transcribed regions of genes whose products play key roles in development and cell-cell signaling. Surprisingly, the expression of a subset of these genes is positively regulated by macroH2A1. MacroH2A1 also plays a role in augmenting signal-regulated transcription, specifically for genes responsive to serum starvation. Collectively, our results document an unexpected role for macroH2A1 in the escape from heterochromatin-associated silencing and the enhancement of autosomal gene transcription.},

abstract = {MacroH2A1 is a histone variant harboring an ∼25-kDa carboxyl-terminal macrodomain. Due to its enrichment on the inactive X chromosome, macroH2A1 was thought to play a role in transcriptional repression. However, recent studies have shown that macroH2A1 occupies autosomal chromatin and regulates genes in a context-specific manner. The macrodomain may play a role in the modulation of gene expression outcomes via physical interactions with effector proteins, which may depend on the ability of the macrodomain to bind NAD(+) metabolite ligands. Here, we identify proline, glutamic acid, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), a chromatin-associated factor and transcriptional coregulator, as a ligand-independent macrodomain-interacting factor. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with tiling microarrays (ChIP-chip) to determine the genomic localization of PELP1 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We find that PELP1 genomic localization is highly correlated with that of macroH2A1. Additionally, PELP1 positively correlates with heterochromatic chromatin marks and negatively correlates with active transcription marks, much like macroH2A1. MacroH2A1 specifically recruits PELP1 to the promoters of macroH2A1 target genes, but macroH2A1 occupancy occurs independent of PELP1. This recruitment allows macroH2A1 and PELP1 to cooperatively regulate gene expression outcomes.},
