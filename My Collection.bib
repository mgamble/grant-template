abstract = {Transcriptional activation requires both access to DNA assembled as chromatin and functional contact with components of the basal transcription machinery. Using the hormone-bound vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) ligand binding domain (LBD) as an affinity matrix, we previously identified a novel multisubunit coactivator complex, DRIP (VDR-interacting proteins), required for transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors and several other transcription factors. In this report, we characterize the nuclear receptor binding features of DRIP205, a key subunit of the DRIP complex, that interacts directly with VDR and thyroid hormone receptor in response to ligand and anchors the other DRIP subunits to the nuclear receptor LBD. In common with other nuclear receptor coactivators, DRIP205 interaction occurs through one of two LXXLL motifs and requires the receptor's AF-2 subdomain. Although the second motif of DRIP205 is required only for VDR binding in vitro, both motifs are used in the context of an retinoid X receptor-VDR heterodimer on DNA and in transactivation in vivo. We demonstrate that both endogenous p160 coactivators and DRIP complexes bind to the VDR LBD from nuclear extracts through similar sequence requirements, but they do so as distinct complexes. Moreover, in contrast to the p160 family of coactivators, the DRIP complex is devoid of any histone acetyltransferase activity. The results demonstrate that different coactivator complexes with distinct functions bind to the same transactivation region of nuclear receptors, suggesting that they are both required for transcription activation by nuclear receptors.},

abstract = {<p>The growth of telomerase-deficient cancers depends on the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a homology-directed telomere-maintenance pathway. ALT telomeres exhibit a unique chromatin environment and generally lack the nucleosome remodeler ATRX, pointing to an epigenetic basis for ALT. Recently, we identified a protective role for the ATRX-interacting macroH2A1.2 histone variant during homologous recombination and replication stress (RS). Consistent with an inherent susceptibility to RS, we show that human ALT telomeres are highly enriched for macroH2A1.2. However, in contrast to ATRX-proficient cells, ALT telomeres transiently lose macroH2A1.2 during acute RS to facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, a process that is almost completely prevented by ectopic ATRX expression. Telomeric macroH2A1.2 is re-deposited in a DNA damage response (DDR)-dependent manner to promote homologous recombination-associated ALT pathways. Our findings thus identify the dynamic exchange of macroH2A1.2 on chromatin as an epigenetic link among ATRX loss, RS-induced DDR initiation and telomere maintenance via homologous recombination.</p>},

@article{Gamble2005,
abstract = {To uncover factors required for transcription by RNA polymerase II on chromatin, we fractionated a mammalian cell nuclear extract. We identified the histone chaperone TAF-I (also known as INHAT [inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase]), which was previously proposed to repress transcription, as a potent activator of chromatin transcription responsive to the vitamin D  3  receptor or to Gal4-VP16. TAF-I associates with chromatin in vitro and can substitute for the related protein NAP-1 in assembling chromatin onto cloned DNA templates in cooperation with the remodeling enzyme ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor (ACF). The chromatin assembly and transcriptional activation functions are distinct, however, and can be dissociated temporally. Efficient transcription of chromatin assembled with TAF-I still requires the presence of TAF-I during the polymerization reaction. Conversely, TAF-I cannot stimulate transcript elongation when added after the other factors necessary for assembly of a preinitiation complex on naked DNA. Thus, TAF-I is required to facilitate transcription at a step after chromatin assembly but before transcript elongation.},
