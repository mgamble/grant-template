Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but relies on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms can also arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. The \gls{rtk} AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR. Regulation of AXL by \gls{ptdser}, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL-targeted therapy especially challenging\cite{Rachez2000}.

This work will considerably improve our ability to identify efficacious drug combinations by: (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which \glspl{rtk} are driving bypass resistance, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted \glspl{rtk} both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the \gls{rtk} AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance.
